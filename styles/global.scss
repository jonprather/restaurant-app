// TODO (
//

// last touches jus tmade margin auto top fix for yannal
// footer is alos jank so are some of the margins on mobile
// looking too big not balanced in spots maybe replace with tailwind based stuff idk
// cart text is pretty small ob mobilez
// like could be bigger for icons clickability and stuff
// was thinking about the push down effect from having set a fixed width on header pragrah so the margin isnt consisntent when there is overflow when text overflows....
// //fixed i had a fixed hight so i changed that then updated the margin
// yeah maybe look at some more designs for mobile to get a good feel for what it should look like a range of values
// but im close ...
// yeah attention to detail on the design...
