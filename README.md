## Installation

1. `npm install`
2. Add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHEC_PUBLIC_API_KEY` to `.env`
3. `npm run dev`

First, You'll need to create an account at [Chec](https://commercejs.com) or use the [CLI](https://github.com/chec/cli).

You can get a copy of your public API key at [Chec Dashboard > Developer Settings](https://dashboard.chec.io/settings/developer).

It would also be useful to make a few categories with some products as well as an 'all' category for containg all the products.

note: _If you don't want to create an account with Commerce.js, you can use the demo store public key `pk_184625ed86f36703d7d233bcf6d519a4f9398f20048ec`._

## Acknowledgements

#### Code Resources to Acknowledge

- [https://github.com/notrab/nextjs-commercejs-example](https://github.com/notrab/nextjs-commercejs-example)

While I appreciated the notrab tutorial on commerce.js with next.js, I wasn't happy with how the data was handled. I ended up re-writing all of the code and extending it for improved performance and user experience.

In particular, I switched from SSR to SSG and from reducers to react query. This enabled me to entirely remove the store and move all the App state logic into react query where it manages syncing to server state.

#### Design Resources to Acknowledge

The desktop design of the home page was inspired by a dribble design:

I Purchased the figma design from:

- As far as the code for the design, it was based on code I had from an earlier project in Laravel that I improved upon. In this project i greatly extended my orignal code. And did a custom design for the menu cart pages.
